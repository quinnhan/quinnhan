- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @quinnhan
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in using data to help growth whether it's business growth or my growth. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data scientist techniques such as feature engineering, prediction model and knowledge such as probability and statistics
- My GitHub is quite empty because of my lack of time in the past 3 years. I now devote myself to public work starting with GitHub, Kaggle, StackOverflow. I hope to find myself a bit more confident to start writing blogs and mentoring others.
- ðŸ“« Please say hi to me on LinkedIn and give me any feedbacks, comments or suggestions. I try my best to answer all inquiries.
